#PSA for people with wildly different temperatures:  Klipper has a known issue 
#with the NTC 100K beta 3950 thermistor type, which is a very common one.  
#There are fixes to be applied to your config file if you are using this 
#thermistor to get more accurate temperatures.  The issue is that the 
#temperature curve is calculated assuming the thermistor behaves 100% 
#correctly, but it doesn't.  The fix is to use a different method of 
#thermistor temperature reporting, which follows the natural curve of the 
#reported vs. actual values closer.

#The issue is explained in this Klipper issue:  
#https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/issues/4054#issuecomment-830721715

#The fix (as of 2021-10-08) is to add your own thermistor definition to printer.cfg, 
#and update the thermistor in your [extruder] section
